You have nothing to lose,you are already naked.Don't trapped by dogma,which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
Don't let the noise of others' opinion drown out your own inner voice,heart and intuition.
Work is going to take a large part of your life,the only way to be satisfied is to do the great work,and the only way to do the great work is to love what you do.If you haven't found out what you love to do,keep looking,don't settle.
Stay hungry,stay foolish.
